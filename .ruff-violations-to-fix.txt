# RUFF VIOLATIONS REMOVED FROM ruff.toml - MUST BE FIXED

## CODE QUALITY / COMPLEXITY (LAZY - MUST REFACTOR)
PLC0415 - Lazy imports (import inside function) - 14 files
C901 - Function too complex (complexity > 10) - 11 files
PLR0911 - Too many return statements (> 6) - 4 files
PLR0912 - Too many branches (> 16) - 6 files
PLR0915 - Too many statements (> 96) - 5 files
PLR0913 - Too many arguments (> 30) - 2 files

## SECURITY (MUST FIX PROPERLY)
S603 - subprocess.call without shell=False - can be exploited
S607 - subprocess with partial executable path - can be hijacked
S110 - try/except pass - silently swallows errors

## CODE QUALITY / STYLE (LAZY - MUST FIX)
ARG001 - Unused function argument - should remove or use
ARG002 - Unused method argument - should remove or use
SIM108 - Use ternary operator instead of if-else - simplify
N806 - Variable name not lowercase - fix naming
PTH123 - open() instead of Path.open() - use pathlib
PLR2004 - Magic number in comparison - extract to constant
SIM115 - Use context manager for file operations - fix properly
B007 - Unused loop variable - use _ or fix logic
ERA001 - Commented out code - remove or uncomment
B018 - Useless expression statement - fix or remove
B023 - Function uses loop variable in closure - fix binding
