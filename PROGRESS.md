# IDP Implementation Progress

## Overview
This document tracks the implementation progress of the Intelligent Document Processing (IDP) system. Only completed tasks are listed here.

## Completed Tasks

### Documentation and Planning
- ✅ Created IDP.md specification
- ✅ Created GRAPH_API.md specification

- ✅ Examined UnifiedCRUD multi-storage sync
- ✅ Refined specifications to leverage existing architecture

### Document Models (Phase 1)
- ✅ Created Document StorageModel with multi-storage configs
- ✅ Defined storage_configs for graph, vector, relational, cache
- ✅ Added appropriate indexes for each storage type
- ✅ Implemented to_storage_dict() for proper serialization
- ✅ Created DocumentSection StorageModel with hierarchy support
- ✅ Created DocumentTable StorageModel for structured data
- ✅ Created DocumentImage StorageModel for visual content

### Document Extractors (Phase 1)
- ✅ Created base DocumentExtractor abstract class
- ✅ Implemented PDFExtractor with PyMuPDF support
- ✅ Implemented DOCXExtractor with python-docx support
- ✅ Implemented SpreadsheetExtractor for CSV/Excel files

- ✅ Registered all document tools with MCP registry

### Storage Integration (Phase 2)
- ✅ Verified pgvector extension in PostgreSQL
- ✅ Created PgVectorDAO implementation with auto-embeddings
- ✅ Implemented vector_search and semantic_search methods
- ✅ Registered PgVectorDAO with DAOFactory
- ✅ Fixed SQL injection vulnerabilities with proper validation
- ✅ Added real embedding generation with sentence-transformers
- ✅ Extended DgraphDAO with graph-specific operations (k-hop, shortest path, components)
- ✅ Implemented PostgreSQLDAO with dynamic table creation and schema inference
- ✅ Created RedisDAO with caching methods and TTL support
- ✅ Added DAOFactory for managing storage implementations

### Image Analysis Integration (Phase 3)
- ✅ Created GeminiClient with rate limiting
- ✅ Implemented image analysis methods for documents
- ✅ Added OCR and chart data extraction capabilities
- ✅ Included batch processing support

### Testing and Quality (Phase 4)
- ✅ Fixed SQL injection vulnerabilities with identifier validation
- ✅ Resolved type annotation issues (PYI034, PYI036)
- ✅ Fixed import paths for extractors
- ✅ All modules successfully committed and pushed

### Documentation (Phase 5)
- ✅ Updated root README.md with IDP system information
- ✅ Updated base module README with storage integration details
- ✅ Created files module README with comprehensive documentation
- ✅ Created ARCHITECTURE.md with system design details
- ✅ Fixed orchestrator test runner configuration

## Current Status

**✅ IDP IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE**

All phases of the Intelligent Document Processing system have been successfully implemented:
- Document models with multi-storage support
- Extractors for PDF, DOCX, Excel, and images
- MCP server integration with document tools
- Storage implementations (PgVector, PostgreSQL, Redis, Dgraph)
- Gemini AI integration for image analysis
- Comprehensive documentation

The system is now ready for production use with:
- Multi-format document processing
- Semantic search capabilities
- Automatic multi-storage synchronization
- AI-powered image and chart analysis
