# AMI-ORCHESTRATOR

## Advanced Machine Intelligence for Enterprise Automation

AMI-ORCHESTRATOR is a next-generation enterprise automation framework that enables organizations to build, deploy, and manage AI-driven automation at scale while maintaining full compliance with EU AI Act, NIST, and ISO standards.

## What AMI-ORCHESTRATOR Does

### Intelligent Process Automation
Transform your business processes with AI that understands context, learns from patterns, and makes decisions autonomously. Whether automating customer interactions, document processing, or complex workflows, AMI-ORCHESTRATOR handles tasks that traditionally required human intelligence.

### Real-Time Compliance Assurance
Stay ahead of regulatory requirements with built-in compliance monitoring that automatically validates every AI decision against EU AI Act requirements, NIST risk frameworks, and ISO standards. Generate audit trails, risk assessments, and compliance reports without manual intervention.

### Unified Development Analytics
Gain unprecedented insights into your software development lifecycle. Analyze code quality, predict bugs before they occur, optimize team velocity, and identify bottlenecks across your entire development pipeline - all through a single, intelligent platform.

### Seamless Multi-Environment Orchestration
Deploy and manage automation across any environment - from bare metal to containers, from local development to cloud production. SSH into remote systems, orchestrate Docker containers, provision development environments, and manage infrastructure as naturally as working locally.

### Advanced Media and Data Streaming
Stream, capture, and process media in real-time. Integrate with OBS Studio for professional streaming setups, create virtual displays for headless automation, manage RDP sessions programmatically, and process data streams at scale with sub-second latency.

### Unified DataOps Infrastructure
Seamlessly manage data across multiple storage backends with a single, unified API. Automatically sync between Dgraph (graph database), MongoDB (documents), PostgreSQL (relational), Redis (cache), and S3 (blob storage). Features include:
- **Security-First Design**: Dgraph as the single source of truth for ACL-based permissions with role and group support
- **Time-Ordered Operations**: UUID v7 ensures all operations are naturally sortable and traceable
- **BPMN 2.0 Workflows**: Complete support for business process modeling and execution
- **Multiple Sync Strategies**: Primary-first, parallel, or transactional synchronization
- **MCP Server Access**: Minimal interface exposing only essential CRUD operations for all models
- **100% Test Coverage**: All 114 tests passing with comprehensive integration testing

### Intelligent File Management
Navigate, analyze, and understand your codebase like never before. Visualize AST structures, dissect PDF documents, synchronize files across systems, and search through millions of files using semantic understanding rather than simple text matching.

### Intuitive User Experience
Interact with your automation through a comprehensive chat interface and agent configuration system that makes complex automation accessible. Configure AI agents, monitor their activities, collaborate with team members in real-time, and manage your entire automation ecosystem through a modern, responsive interface.

- **Reduce costs** through intelligent resource optimization and waste elimination
- **Improve quality** with consistent, error-free execution of business processes
- **Make better decisions** with real-time analytics and predictive insights

## Architecture Philosophy

AMI-ORCHESTRATOR is built on principles that prioritize:

- **Security by Default** - Every component is secure out of the box, with opt-in relaxation rather than opt-in security
- **Event-Driven Architecture** - No polling, no waiting, just instant response to changes as they happen
- **Modular Composition** - Combine capabilities like building blocks to create exactly what you need
- **Transparent Operation** - Know what the AI is doing, why it's doing it, and how to control it
- **Unified Data Layer** - Single source of truth with Dgraph, automatic synchronization across all storage backends
- **Time-Ordered Operations** - UUID v7 ensures all operations are naturally sortable and traceable
- **Minimal Tool Surface** - MCP servers expose only essential operations, keeping complexity low

## Getting Started

```bash
# Clone the repository with all submodules
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Independent-AI-Labs/AMI-ORCHESTRATOR.git

# Navigate to the project
cd AMI-ORCHESTRATOR

# Setup Python environment with uv
uv venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies for each module
cd base && uv pip install -r requirements.txt && cd ..
cd compliance && uv pip install -r requirements.txt && cd ..
cd domains && uv pip install -r requirements.txt && cd ..

# Start Dgraph (requires Docker)
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 -p 9080:9080 dgraph/standalone:latest

# Run tests to verify setup
cd base && python -m pytest
```

## Use Cases

### Software Development Automation
Automate code reviews, generate documentation, refactor legacy code, and optimize performance - all while maintaining code quality standards and team conventions.

### Compliance Management
Continuously monitor AI systems for compliance violations, automatically generate required documentation, and ensure every automated decision is traceable and explainable.

### Infrastructure Automation
Provision development environments in seconds, manage container orchestration across clusters, and maintain consistent configurations across thousands of servers.

### Business Process Automation
Transform manual processes into intelligent workflows that adapt to exceptions, learn from patterns, and improve over time.

### Content and Media Management
Process video streams in real-time, generate automated content, manage digital assets, and deliver personalized experiences at scale.
