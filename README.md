### Installation - Five Minutes to Freedom

```bash
# Clone your future
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Independent-AI-Labs/AMI-ORCHESTRATOR.git
cd AMI-ORCHESTRATOR

# Setup - one command per module
for module in base browser files; do
    cd $module && uv venv .venv && uv pip install -r requirements.txt && cd ..
done

# Launch - your automation platform is ready
python base/scripts/run_dataops.py  # Your data layer
python browser/scripts/run_chrome.py  # Your browser automation
