## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.12+ (or Docker, or Kubernetes, or bare metal)
- Git (to clone once and own forever)
- Your servers (or laptop, or Raspberry Pi, or data center)

### Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Independent-AI-Labs/AMI-ORCHESTRATOR.git
cd AMI-ORCHESTRATOR

# Run the orchestrator setup (delegates to base; manages per-module configs)
python module_setup.py

# Validate configs and types/lints per module
python scripts/validate_all.py

# Enforce empty __init__.py files repository-wide
python scripts/ensure_empty_inits.py --fix
```

## Distributed Compute & Work Pooling (WIP)

### Intelligent Work Distribution
AMI-ORCHESTRATOR reduces cloud dependency through smart work distribution:

- **Automatic Pool Management** - Workers scale from 0 to 1000+ based on demand
- **Resource Optimization** - Hibernates idle workers, pre-warms for instant response
- **Hybrid Execution** - Seamlessly distribute work between on-premise and cloud
- **Cost Reduction** - Utilize existing hardware before spinning up cloud resources

### Sandboxed Execution Environment
Every task runs in isolation for security and compliance:

- **Process Isolation** - Each worker runs in its own sandboxed environment
- **Resource Limits** - CPU, memory, and I/O constraints per task
- **Network Segmentation** - Control which tasks can access which resources
- **Audit Trail** - Complete record of task execution and resource usage
