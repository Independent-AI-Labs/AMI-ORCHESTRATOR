    """Base compliance validation engine"""
    
    async def validate_eu_ai_act(self, system_config: dict) -> ComplianceReport:
        """Validate against EU AI Act requirements"""
        pass
    
    async def validate_nist(self, system_config: dict) -> RiskAssessment:
        """Validate against NIST AI RMF"""
        pass
    
    async def validate_iso(self, standard: str, system_config: dict) -> ValidationResult:
        """Validate against specific ISO standard"""
        pass
```

### Risk Assessment Framework
```python
class RiskAssessmentEngine:
    """AI system risk assessment"""
    
    def classify_risk_level(self, ai_system: AISystem) -> RiskLevel:
        """Classify AI system risk per EU AI Act"""
        pass
    
    def generate_impact_assessment(self, ai_system: AISystem) -> ImpactAssessment:
        """Generate privacy and societal impact assessment"""
        pass
    
    def identify_mitigation_strategies(self, risks: List[Risk]) -> List[Mitigation]:
        """Propose risk mitigation strategies"""
        pass
```
