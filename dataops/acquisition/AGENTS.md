# Agent Guidelines

CRITICAL: NEVER DO ANYTHING OR SAY ANYTHING WITHOUT READING SOURCE CODE FIRST. NO INTERACTIONS, NO EDITS, NO ASSUMPTIONS. EVERYTHING IS FORBIDDEN UNTIL YOU READ THE RELEVANT SOURCE CODE. This is ABSOLUTE.

This module follows the same guidelines as the parent AMI-ORCHESTRATOR repository.
See the root AGENTS.md for complete guidelines.

Module-specific notes:
- This module contains data acquisition and retrieval scripts
- All scripts must follow the code quality rules defined in ruff.toml and mypy.ini
- Use uv-native workflows for dependency management
