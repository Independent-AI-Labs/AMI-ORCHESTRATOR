# Documentation Index

The `docs/` folder captures orchestrator-wide policies and the modernization state of each module. Use the table below to jump to the artefacts most relevant to the current compliance and engineering workstream.

| Topic | File |
| --- | --- |
| Architecture and ownership map | `Architecture-Map.md` |
| Setup contract between root and modules | `Setup-Contract.md` |
| Toolchain bootstrap guidance (uv + Python 3.12) | `Toolchain-Bootstrap.md` |
| Quality policy & guardrails | `Quality-Policy.md` |
| Integration status tracker | `Integration-Status.md` |
| Documentation gaps & backlog | `Docs-Gaps.md` |
| NextAuth rollout notes for the UX module | `NextAuth-Integration.md` |
| ISMS functionality requirements for the platform | `ISMS-Functionality-Spec.md` |
| CMS architecture assessment | `CMS-Architecture-Assessment.md` |

Suggested reading order when onboarding a change:
1. `Architecture-Map.md`
2. `Setup-Contract.md`
3. `Toolchain-Bootstrap.md`
4. `Quality-Policy.md`
5. `Integration-Status.md`
6. `Docs-Gaps.md`

Compliance reference material lives under `compliance/docs/`. That directory should be consulted alongside this index when planning implementation work.
