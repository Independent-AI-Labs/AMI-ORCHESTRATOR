# What is Open AMI?

**For**: Technical Leaders, Architects, Engineers
**Reading Time**: 15 minutes
**Prerequisites**: Basic understanding of AI/ML concepts

> **⚠️ STATUS**: This document describes **target architecture and research vision**, not current production capabilities. Most advanced features (self-evolution, formal verification, SPNs/CSTs) are in research/specification phase (Q4 2025 - Q2 2026). For operational capabilities, see [AMI-ORCHESTRATOR README](../../../README.md).

## The 30-Second Answer

**Open AMI** (Advanced Machine Intelligence) is a **research framework** and long-term roadmap for building AI systems that aim to be:

- **Self-Evolving**: AI improves itself through verified steps with formal validation [TARGET]
- **Formally Assured**: Mathematical verification techniques applied to safety-critical constraints [TARGET]
- **Fully Accountable**: Every decision traceable to human-specified rules [PARTIAL]
- **Compliance-Ready**: Architecture designed for EU AI Act, ISO/IEC, NIST standards [MAPPED]
- **Cryptographically Verified**: Tamper-evident audit trail for all operations [PARTIAL]

**Current Reality**: Production infrastructure (DataOps, MCP servers, audit logging) provides foundation. Advanced capabilities are theoretical targets.

## The Problem: AI's Trust Gap

### Today's AI Systems Have Critical Weaknesses

```
Traditional AI Development:
┌────────────────────────────────────┐
│  1. Design model manually          │
│  2. Train on data (hope it works)  │
│  3. Test empirically               │
│  4. Deploy (fingers crossed)       │
│  5. Monitor for failures           │
│  6. Repeat when it breaks          │
└────────────────────────────────────┘
       ↓
   Problems:
   • No guarantees of safety
   • Black box decision-making
   • Unpredictable behavior
   • Compliance nightmares
   • Value drift over time
```

### Specific Pain Points

**1. The Alignment Problem**
- AI objectives often misalign with human intent
- "Specification gaming": AI exploits loopholes
- No way to ensure alignment persists as AI evolves

**2. The Explainability Problem**
- Neural networks are black boxes
- Cannot explain why AI made a decision
- Regulators demand explanations (EU AI Act Art. 13)

**3. The Verification Problem**
- Testing is empirical, not exhaustive
- Edge cases cause failures
- No mathematical guarantees

**4. The Evolution Problem**
- Improving AI requires manual retraining
- Each version is a new black box
- Cannot verify improvements are safe

**5. The Accountability Problem**
- Cannot trace decisions to origin
- Audit logs are incomplete
- No tamper-evident records

## The Solution: Open AMI's Approach

Open AMI **proposes solutions** to these problems through three integrated innovations (currently in research phase):

### Innovation 1: Four Pillars Architecture

Open AMI is built on four inseparable pillars:

```
┌─────────────┬─────────────┬─────────────┬─────────────┐
│ COMPLIANCE  │  INTEGRITY  │ ABSTRACTION │  DYNAMICS   │
├─────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────┤
│ Ethical,    │ Crypto-     │ Navigable   │ Robust      │
│ legal, safe │ graphically │ complexity  │ adaptation  │
│ by design   │ verified    │ management  │ control     │
└─────────────┴─────────────┴─────────────┴─────────────┘
         ↓              ↓              ↓              ↓
    Every AI operation is simultaneously:
    • Compliant with rules
    • Verified for integrity
    • Understandable at appropriate level
    • Robust and stable
```

**Compliance**: Formal specification ($\mathcal{CM}$) of ethical, legal, safety requirements enforced at runtime

**Integrity**: Cryptographic guarantees for data/computation correctness using CSTs, HSMs, distributed verification

**Abstraction**: Multi-level representations (from low-level weights to high-level concepts) for transparency

**Dynamics**: Adaptive learning with stability guarantees, preventing catastrophic forgetting

### Innovation 2: Verified Evolution

Open AMI proposes a **verification-first approach** to AI evolution:

```
Traditional AI Evolution:        Open AMI Approach (Target):
┌──────────────────────┐          ┌──────────────────────┐
│ Model v1             │          │ Layer 0: Axioms      │
│ (train & deploy)     │          │ (formal safety spec) │
└──────────┬───────────┘          └──────────┬───────────┘
           │                                  │
           ↓ (hope)                          ↓ (validates against)
┌──────────────────────┐          ┌──────────────────────┐
│ Model v2             │          │ Model v1             │
│ (retrain manually)   │          │ (formally verified)  │
└──────────┬───────────┘          └──────────┬───────────┘
           │                                  │
           ↓ (hope)                          ↓ (proposes improvement)
┌──────────────────────┐          ┌──────────────────────┐
│ Model v3             │          │ Model v2             │
│ (test empirically)   │          │ (verified against v0)│
└──────────┬───────────┘          └──────────┬───────────┘
           │                                  │
          ...                                ...
           │                                  │
           ↓ (value drift?)                  ↓ (provable safety)
┌──────────────────────┐          ┌──────────────────────┐
│ Model v100           │          │ Model v100           │
│ (who knows?)         │          │ (still validated)    │
└──────────────────────┘          └──────────────────────┘
```

**Key Principle**: Each evolution step must validate against the original safety specification before deployment.

### Innovation 3: Constraint Preservation (Monotonic Safety Properties)

**The Problem with Traditional AI Evolution**:
```
AI_v1: Aligned ✓
  ↓ (improve)
AI_v10: Aligned ✓
  ↓ (improve)
AI_v100: Aligned ✓
  ↓ (improve)
AI_v1000: Aligned? ❓ (value drift!)
```

**Open AMI's Approach (Target)**:
```
Layer 0 Axioms (immutable, human-specified safety constraints)
         ↓ (validates against)
    AI_v1: Verified compliance with Layer 0 ✓
         ↓ (evolves with proof)
    AI_v10: Verified compliance with Layer 0 ✓
         ↓ (evolves with proof)
    AI_v100: Verified compliance with Layer 0 ✓
         ↓ (evolves with proof)
    AI_v1000: Verified compliance with Layer 0 ✓

Safety constraints are preserved across all evolution steps (monotonic property).
```

  evolve(ai_v_n) = ai_v_next →
  satisfies_axioms(ai_v_next, layer0_axioms)

## FAQ

### Q: Is Open AMI production-ready?

**A**: The **AMI-ORCHESTRATOR infrastructure** is production-ready (DataOps, MCP servers, audit logging, 60+ tests). The **advanced OpenAMI features** (self-evolution, formal verification, SPNs/CSTs) are in research/specification phase with implementation targeted for Q4 2025 - Q2 2026. No "v1.0.0-rc1" release exists; refer to git tags for actual versions.

### Q: How does self-evolution work in practice?

**A**: Self-evolution is a **theoretical concept** currently. The proposed 8-step protocol (see "How It Works" section) combines two research approaches but is **not yet implemented**. See [SYNTHESIS-OPENAMI-BOOTSTRAP.md](../../../learning/SYNTHESIS-OPENAMI-BOOTSTRAP.md) for the theoretical framework.

### Q: What about performance overhead?

**A**: Performance overhead for formal verification is **estimated** (proofs ~seconds to minutes), but this is speculative since the verification system is not implemented. Current production infrastructure (MCP servers, DataOps) has minimal overhead (<5% for audit logging).

### Q: Can Open AMI work with existing ML frameworks?

**A**: **Theoretical design** proposes wrapping existing models (TensorFlow, PyTorch) in SPNs with verification layers, but this is **not yet implemented**. Current system provides infrastructure that could support such integration. See [Research Specifications](../../../compliance/docs/research/OpenAMI/) for the proposed approach.

### Q: What about closed-source LLMs (GPT-4, Claude)?

**A**: The **theoretical** design proposes using LLMs as external tools within verified SPNs. Self-evolution would require open models for architecture modification. Current system uses LLMs via MCP integration but without the proposed verification layers.

### Q: Is Open AMI open source?

**A**: Yes. AMI-ORCHESTRATOR is MIT licensed (see [LICENSE](../../../LICENSE)). The codebase is open-source with no commercial licensing mentioned in the repository.
