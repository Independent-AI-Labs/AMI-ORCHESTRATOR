# Open AMI

**Framework for building AI systems with formal safety guarantees, compliance-by-design, and complete auditability.**

> **‚ö†Ô∏è STATUS**: OpenAMI is a research framework describing future capabilities. The production [AMI-ORCHESTRATOR](../../README.md) platform implements foundational infrastructure (DataOps, MCP servers, audit trails), but advanced OpenAMI features (formal verification, self-modification) remain in research phase (target Q4 2025 - Q2 2026).

## What This Is

Open AMI is a framework and long-term roadmap for self-evolving AI systems that can prove their own safety. Core concept: AI that improves itself through formally verified steps, with cryptographic proof and human oversight ensuring it won't violate safety constraints. Every decision and change is traceable to specific data, code, and responsible individuals.

## Current Status

### ‚úÖ Production Infrastructure (AMI-ORCHESTRATOR - OPERATIONAL TODAY)

**Audit and Provenance**:
- ‚úÖ Cryptographic audit trails (UUID v7, immutable logging)
- ‚úÖ Complete provenance tracking for all operations
- ‚úÖ Multi-storage DataOps (Dgraph, PostgreSQL, PgVector, Redis, OpenBao, REST)
- ‚úÖ Access control and authentication systems

**MCP Servers** (50+ production tools):
- ‚úÖ DataOps server (10 tools): CRUD, search, query
- ‚úÖ SSH server (4 tools): command execution, file transfer
- ‚úÖ Browser server (11 families): navigation, interaction, scraping
- ‚úÖ Files server (27 tools): file operations, search, metadata

**Quality Assurance**:
- ‚úÖ 60+ integration tests
- ‚úÖ Production-ready automation
- ‚úÖ Compliance mapping documentation

See [main README](../../README.md) for complete production capabilities.

### üìã Research Phase (Estimated Q4 2025 - Q2 2026)

**Advanced Features**:
- Isolated execution environments: sandboxed processes with cryptographic attestation
- Cryptographically signed state snapshots: tamper-proof state representation
- Formal verification integration: proof systems (Lean, Coq, or similar)
- Self-modification with verification: verified transformation pipelines
- Compliance MCP server with governance tools

**Research Framework Documented**:
- Four design principles: **Compliance** (regulatory mapping), **Integrity** (cryptographic audit trails), **Abstraction** (layered safety guarantees), **Dynamics** (controlled evolution)
- Constraint preservation mechanisms (safety rules that can never be weakened)
- Compliance mapping: EU AI Act, ISO 42001, ISO 27001, NIST
