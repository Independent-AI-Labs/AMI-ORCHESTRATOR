# Open AMI System Architecture

**For**: Technical Leaders, Architects, Senior Engineers
**Reading Time**: 15-20 minutes
**Prerequisites**: [GUIDE-FRAMEWORK.md](./GUIDE-FRAMEWORK.md)

> **⚠️ CRITICAL NOTE**: This document describes the **TARGET ARCHITECTURE** for Open AMI, not the current production state of AMI-ORCHESTRATOR. Most components described here are in **research/specification phase** (Q4 2025 - Q2 2026). For actual production capabilities, see the [main README](../../README.md) and [Implementation Reality Check](#implementation-reality-check) at the end of this document.

> **⚠️ COMPLEXITY WARNING**: This architecture involves significant unsolved research challenges, including:
> - Formal verification of neural networks at scale (open research problem)
> - Specification of "safety" in formal logic for natural language domains
> - Meta-verification (who verifies the verifier after evolution?)
> - Computational feasibility of proof generation for complex AI systems

## Executive Summary

Open AMI proposes a **four-layer architecture** that integrates **four design principles** for accountable, self-evolving AI systems. The research framework aims to combine:

1. **Formal safety assurances** (mathematical verification techniques, immutable constraints)
2. **Verified evolution** (validation before deployment through empirical tests and formal proofs)
3. **Multi-party verification** (Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus with 4/5 independent verifiers)
4. **Complete audit trail** (cryptographic provenance tracking, partially implemented at base/backend/dataops/security/audit_trail.py)

**Research Goal**: Explore approaches for AI capability growth while maintaining verifiable alignment with specified safety constraints and complete accountability.

**Key Challenge**: Formal methods typically apply to deterministic systems, but AI models exhibit stochastic and emergent behavior that resists formal analysis.

---

## The Four Design Principles

Every component in Open AMI is designed around four inseparable principles:

```
┌─────────────┬─────────────┬─────────────┬─────────────┐
│ COMPLIANCE  │  INTEGRITY  │ ABSTRACTION │  DYNAMICS   │
├─────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────┤
│ Regulatory  │ Crypto-     │ Multi-level │ Controlled  │
│ alignment,  │ graphically │ representa- │ adaptation  │
│ ethical,    │ verified    │ tions for   │ with        │
│ legal safe  │ audit trail │ transparen- │ stability   │
│ by design   │ & compute   │ cy at scale │ guarantees  │
└─────────────┴─────────────┴─────────────┴─────────────┘
```

**Compliance**: Formal specification of ethical, legal, safety requirements enforced at runtime through regulatory mappings (EU AI Act Article 13 & 14, ISO 42001, NIST AI RMF) and architectural enforcement.

**Integrity**: Cryptographic guarantees for data and computation correctness using UUID v7 timestamps, cryptographic signatures, and tamper-evident storage for audit trails and state snapshots.

**Abstraction**: Multi-level representations (weights → concepts) for transparency, providing technical details for developers and high-level explanations for auditors through layered documentation and visualization tools.

**Dynamics**: Adaptive learning with stability guarantees, preventing catastrophic forgetting through empirical testing, continuous monitoring, and formal verification (future).

**Implementation Status**:
- Compliance: Documented in external research: [compliance/docs/research/OpenAMI/](https://github.com/Independent-AI-Labs/AMI-COMPLIANCE/tree/main/docs/research/OpenAMI/)
- Integrity: PARTIAL - audit_trail.py (base/backend/dataops/security/audit_trail.py) in production
- Abstraction: Research phase
- Dynamics: Research phase

## The Four-Layer Architecture

Open AMI is structured as four bidirectional layers with clear accountability at each level:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

## Layer 1: Foundation

### Purpose

Provides **immutable safety constraints** that can never be modified by the AI, regardless of evolution.

### Key Components

#### Immutable Safety Constraints

> **📋 SPECIFICATION ONLY** - Not yet implemented. Target: Q4 2025.

Formal safety constraints expressing requirements like:
- No deception
- No harm to humans
- Respect for human autonomy
- Explainability requirements (EU AI Act Article 13)
- Fairness constraints
- Verifiability requirements

**Proposed Approach**: Formalize in theorem prover (Lean/Coq) as immutable constraints loaded from secure, cryptographically signed storage during every verification. Version-controlled specifications would be defined by security teams, approved by compliance officers, and validated by regulators.

**Research Challenge**: Translating high-level ethical principles ("no harm") into formal logical predicates that can be mechanically checked is an unsolved problem.

**Reference**: See external specs: [compliance/docs/research/OpenAMI/architecture/pillars.md](https://github.com/Independent-AI-Labs/AMI-COMPLIANCE/blob/main/docs/research/OpenAMI/architecture/pillars.md) for theoretical framework.

#### Core Safety Principles

Immutable execution principles:
- Deterministic execution (same input → same output, reproducible)
- Complete traceability (every action logged with responsible parties)
- Hypothesis-driven evolution (changes require justification)
- Empirical validation (test before deploy)
- Formal verification (prove safety properties)
- Distributed consensus (no single point of failure, 4/5 verifiers agree)
- Rollback capability (can undo changes)
- Human override (humans have final authority)

**Current Status**: Documented principles; not enforced architecturally. Future enforcement would involve automated checks, human approvals, and audit logging at deployment gates.

#### Formal Behavioral Models

Formal mathematical models for goals, processes, and learning. Includes:
- Goal structures (hierarchical representations)
- Process models (state machines for behavior)
- Learning theory (knowledge acquisition)
- Cognitive maps (multi-level abstractions)

Mathematical specifications created by formal methods experts and validated by domain experts using theorem provers and model checkers.

---

## Layer 2: Operational Layer

### Purpose

Provides **verifiable, isolated execution** for all AI operations through distributed execution infrastructure with complete traceability.

### Architecture Overview

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Coordination Layer                                         │

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Key Components

#### Isolated Execution Environments

> **🟡 IMPLICIT ONLY** - Currently realized through module isolation (base/, browser/, files/, nodes/). Explicit abstraction: Target Q4 2025.

**Concept**: Isolated execution environments running AI operations with integrity guarantees.

**Proposed Capabilities**:
- Containerized/TEE-based isolation
- Local compliance checks against requirements specification
- Integrity verification (input/output validation)
- Cryptographic operations (signing, encryption)
- State management via cryptographically signed snapshots

**Current Reality**: Module-level isolation via separate Python packages. No explicit abstraction, no signed snapshots, no formal verification. Future implementation would involve system administrators configuring process boundaries, security teams auditing with cryptographic attestation, and container/TEE logs for traceability.

**Reference**: [process_theory.md](https://github.com/Independent-AI-Labs/AMI-COMPLIANCE/blob/main/docs/research/OpenAMI/architecture/process_theory.md)

#### Workflow Orchestration

> **📋 SPECIFICATION ONLY** - Not yet implemented. Target: Q1 2026.

**Concept**: Coordinate groups of isolated environments for distributed operations.

**Proposed Capabilities**:
- Distribute work across multiple isolated environments
- Aggregate verification results via Byzantine Fault Tolerance (4/5 consensus)
- Enforce system-wide policies from Governance Layer
- Interface between Operational and Intelligence layers

**Research Challenge**: BFT provides fault tolerance but doesn't prevent coordinated manipulation by correctly-functioning-but-malicious nodes. Future implementation would involve system architects designing workflow definitions, operators managing orchestration, and complete logging of workflow state and policy enforcement.

#### Cryptographically Signed State Snapshots

> **📋 SPECIFICATION ONLY** - Not yet implemented. Target: Q4 2025.

**Concept**: Cryptographically signed snapshots of execution environment states for audit and rollback.

**Proposed Structure**:
- State snapshot (model weights, parameters, configuration)
- Cryptographic signature (HSM-signed)
- Timestamp (UUID v7 for ordering)
- Parent snapshot hash (forms provenance chain)

**Current Reality**: Basic audit logging exists (base/backend/dataops/security/audit_trail.py) but doesn't implement full snapshot concept. Future implementation would involve security teams managing HSM signing keys, operators triggering snapshots at significant changes, and secure storage maintaining complete provenance chains for rollback and forensic analysis.

---

## Layer 3: Intelligence

### Purpose

Hosts ML models, learning algorithms, and the **self-modification system** with formal verification and complete traceability.

### Key Components

#### ML Models & Algorithms

Standard machine learning models (neural networks, transformers, etc.) running within isolated environments.

**Current**: Various models can run via MCP servers; no isolation abstraction yet. Model architecture, training data, and hyperparameters are tracked through version control and deployment pipelines, with training runs and deployments logged to model registries.

#### Self-Modification System

> **📋 SPECIFICATION ONLY** - Not yet implemented. Target: Q1-Q2 2026.

**Concept**: AI proposes its own improvements, which are verified before deployment with human oversight at every step.

**Proposed 8-Step Protocol** (see external docs: [SYNTHESIS-OPENAMI-BOOTSTRAP.md](https://github.com/Independent-AI-Labs/AMI-LEARNING/blob/main/SYNTHESIS-OPENAMI-BOOTSTRAP.md)):

1. **Analyze**: Identify improvement opportunity
2. **Design**: Specify change
3. **Compile**: Transform to operations
4. **Test**: Empirical validation
5. **Prove**: Generate formal safety proof
6. **Verify**: Distributed proof checking (4/5 consensus from independent verifiers)
7. **Log**: Create audit entry
8. **Activate**: Deploy if governance approves

**Research Challenges**:
- Proof generation for neural networks is computationally infeasible at scale
- Specification problem: formalizing "improvement" and "safety"
- Who verifies the verifier after it evolves? (infinite regress)

Implementation would involve monitoring systems identifying opportunities, engineers reviewing proposals, QA teams validating, theorem provers generating formal proofs, independent verifiers reaching consensus, audit systems logging all changes, and governance approval gates before deployment.

#### Formal Verification Tools

> **📋 SPECIFICATION ONLY** - Not yet implemented. Target: Q1 2026.

**Concept**: Generate and check formal proofs that AI transformations preserve safety properties.

**Proposed Approach**: Integrate with theorem provers (Lean, Coq, Isabelle) to generate proofs that new model satisfies immutable safety constraints.

**Research Challenge**: Automated theorem proving for complex systems is undecidable (Halting Problem). Proof generation may not terminate or may require prohibitive computational resources.

Implementation would involve formal methods experts designing proof strategies, automated tools generating mathematical proofs of safety properties, verifiers checking proofs before deployment, and complete logging in proof repositories for regulatory compliance.

---

## Layer 4: Governance

### Purpose

Human oversight, policy enforcement, and compliance management ensuring ultimate human accountability.

### Key Components

#### Compliance Requirements Specification

> **📋 SPECIFICATION ONLY** - Not yet implemented. Target: Q1 2026.

**Concept**: Formal specification of all safety, ethical, and regulatory requirements.

**Proposed Contents**:
- Immutable safety constraints (from Layer 1)
- Regulatory mappings (EU AI Act, ISO 42001, NIST AI RMF)
- Risk assessments and mitigation strategies
- Human oversight requirements
- Audit and reporting obligations

**Current Status**: Compliance research documented in external repo: [compliance/docs/research/](https://github.com/Independent-AI-Labs/AMI-COMPLIANCE/tree/main/docs/research/). No runtime enforcement mechanism. Future implementation would involve compliance officers creating formal specifications, regulators approving them, and auditors verifying compliance through formal specification languages and regulatory mappings.

**Reference**: [compliance_manifest.md](https://github.com/Independent-AI-Labs/AMI-COMPLIANCE/blob/main/docs/research/OpenAMI/systems/compliance_manifest.md)

#### Human Oversight Interfaces

Dashboards and controls for human operators to:
- Monitor AI operations in real-time
- Review and approve/reject evolution proposals
- Override AI decisions when necessary
- Conduct audits and investigations
- Update policies (within immutable constraint boundaries)

**Current Status**: Not implemented. Target: Q2 2026. All governance actions would be logged with complete traceability.

---

## The Evolution Protocol

### Unified 8-Step Process

Combines deterministic testing with formal verification into a single evolution cycle with human oversight at critical steps:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 1. ANALYZE: Identify improvement trigger                │
├──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ 2. DESIGN: Specify change in high-level language        │
├──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ 3. COMPILE: Transform to executable operations          │
├──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ 4. TEST: Empirical validation                           │
├──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ 5. PROVE: Generate formal safety proof                  │
├──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ 6. VERIFY: Distributed proof checking (BFT)             │
├──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ 7. LOG: Create audit entry (justification + proof)      │
│    Audit trail: base/backend/dataops/security/audit_trail.py │
├──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ 8. ACTIVATE: Deploy if governance approves              │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Status**: Entirely theoretical. See [GUIDE-FRAMEWORK.md](./GUIDE-FRAMEWORK.md) for details.

Monitoring systems identify performance gaps, ML engineers review proposed changes, build systems compile specifications, QA teams run regression tests, theorem provers generate safety proofs, independent verifiers reach 4/5 consensus, audit systems log complete change records with signatures, and governance boards approve deployment with rollback capability.

### Constraint Preservation

**Principle**: Every evolution step must validate against **original** immutable safety constraints (not evolved versions).

**Mechanism**:
- Immutable safety constraints stored in secure, signed storage
- Proof generator must prove new model satisfies **original** constraints
- 4/5 independent verifiers must agree (Byzantine consensus)
- Only then is evolution approved by governance layer
- All approvals logged with complete traceability

**Research Challenge**: Assumes proof system itself doesn't have bugs. After 1000 evolutions, how do we trust the proof checker? (Meta-verification problem)

Every verifier would sign with cryptographic keys, creating an accountability chain. If bugs are found, tracing to specific verifier versions and responsible parties becomes possible through the complete audit trail.

## Security Considerations

### Threat Model

See [SECURITY-MODEL.md](https://github.com/Independent-AI-Labs/AMI-LEARNING/blob/main/SECURITY-MODEL.md) for full threat model.

**Key Threats**:

1. **Specification gaming**: AI proves compliance while violating intent
   - **Mitigation**: Multiple independent verifiers (5 verifiers, 4/5 consensus)

2. **Proof system bugs**: Vulnerabilities in theorem prover or proof checker
   - **Mitigation**: Multiple diverse proof checkers, formal verification of verifiers

3. **Coordinated manipulation**: 3+ environments colluding to bypass BFT
   - **Mitigation**: Diverse implementations (defense in depth), anomaly detection

4. **Side-channel attacks**: Leaking information via timing, power, etc.
   - **Mitigation**: TEE-based isolation, timing normalization

5. **Supply chain attacks**: Compromised dependencies or hardware
   - **Mitigation**: Dependency pinning, hash verification, signed builds

**Mitigations**:
- Multiple independent proof checkers
- Diverse environment implementations
- HSM-backed cryptographic operations
- Regular security audits and penetration testing
- Formal verification of proof checker itself

### Cryptographic Primitives

**Required**:
- Digital signatures (Ed25519 or ECDSA)
- Hash functions (SHA-256 or BLAKE3)
- Message authentication codes (HMAC)
- Optional: Zero-knowledge proofs for privacy

**Current Status**: Basic cryptographic primitives used for audit trail. No HSM integration yet.

---

## Performance Considerations

> **⚠️ WARNING**: Performance estimates below are **speculative** and not based on actual benchmarks. Formal verification of complex AI systems may be computationally infeasible.

### Estimated Overheads (Speculative)

- **Proof generation**: Unknown (could be seconds to days, or may not terminate)
- **Proof verification**: Unknown (depends on proof complexity)
- **Multi-party consensus**: 1-10 seconds (network latency)
- **Snapshot creation**: <1 second (signing + storage)
- **Audit logging**: <100ms (current implementation at base/backend/dataops/security/audit_trail.py)

### Scalability Challenges

1. **Proof generation doesn't scale**: Formal verification of neural networks with millions of parameters is an open research problem

2. **Storage requirements**: Full provenance chain grows linearly with evolution steps

3. **Network overhead**: Multi-party verification requires synchronization

**Mitigation Strategies** (proposed, not validated):
- Hierarchical verification (prove subcomponents separately)
- Proof caching and reuse
- Incremental verification (prove only changed components)
- Approximate verification (statistical guarantees instead of formal proofs)
