- Executive summary, system architecture, theoretical foundations
- Four Pillars framework (Compliance, Integrity, Abstraction, Dynamics)
- Self-evolution via bootstrapping methodology
- Never-jettison principle and formal verification approach

**Documentation Restructuring:**
- Migrated compliance specs to `docs/research/` hierarchy
