# Next Steps for Local Files MCP Server

## High-Priority Tasks

- **Implement Paranoid Input Validation:**
    - **Path Validation:** Implement strict path validation to prevent access to system-critical directories (e.g., `/etc`, `C:/Windows`, `.ssh`) and to block modifications to executable or script files (e.g., `.exe`, `.bat`, `.sh`).
    - **String/Content Validation:** Add validation for input strings to block potentially dangerous patterns like null bytes or excessive newlines. Implement size limits to prevent memory exhaustion from overly large inputs.

- **Introduce Atomic File Operations with Rollback:**
    - Refactor file modification tools (`write_file`, `edit_*`) to be atomic.
    - Before any modification, create a backup of the original file.
    - If the operation fails for any reason, automatically restore the file from the backup to prevent data corruption or partial writes.
    - Clean up the backup file upon successful completion.

- **Create a Comprehensive Audit Trail:**
    - Implement structured, detailed logging for every file operation in a separate audit log file (e.g., `file_operations_audit.jsonl`).
    - Each log entry should include a timestamp, the operation performed, file path, user context, and details of the request.
    - Before and after each operation, record the file's size and a checksum (e.g., SHA256) to ensure integrity and provide a clear record of changes.

- **Enhance Security:** Implement more robust security measures, such as configurable allowlists and denylists for file access, to restrict the server's file system operations to authorized directories.

- **Improve Configuration:** Introduce a configuration file for the server to allow for more flexible and secure management of settings, such as the maximum file size and logging configurations.

## Low-Priority Tasks

- **Add User-Specific Permissions:** Implement a user-based permission system to control access to specific tools or directories.

- **Improve Performance:** Optimize the file I/O operations to improve performance when working with large files or a high volume of requests.
