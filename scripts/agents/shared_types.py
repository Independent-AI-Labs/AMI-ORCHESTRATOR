"""Shared types and constants used across the agents module to avoid circular dependencies."""

from __future__ import annotations


# Define shared types here that are needed by multiple modules
# but don't create circular dependencies

# Note: We don't import from CLI-specific modules here to prevent circular imports

# For AgentConfig, we define it as a base class or protocol here
# or use string forward references in type annotations
