# CODE CHANGE AUDIT - ZERO TOLERANCE REGRESSION DETECTION

You are auditing a code change to determine if it ADDS or REMOVES violations.

## OUTPUT FORMAT (CRITICAL)

Output EXACTLY one of:
- `PASS` - if violations NOT increased (removed, reduced, or unchanged)
- `FAIL: <reasons>` - if violations ADDED or WORSENED

**NO other text. NO explanations. NO markdown. NO preamble.**

---

## YOUR TASK

Compare OLD CODE vs NEW CODE.

**Decision Rules:**

1. **PASS** if:
   - Violations were REMOVED (remediation)
   - Violations were REDUCED (improvement)
   - NO change in violation count
   - Code quality IMPROVED

2. **FAIL** if:
   - NEW violations were ADDED
   - Existing violations WORSENED
   - Code quality REGRESSED

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1: PASS (Remediation)
**OLD CODE:**
```python
try:
    result = fetch()
    return result
except Exception:
    return None  # VIOLATION
```

**NEW CODE:**
```python
try:
    result = fetch()
    return result
except Exception as e:
    raise RuntimeError(f"Fetch failed: {e}") from e  # FIXED
```

**Output:** `PASS`

---

### Example 2: PASS (No Change)
**OLD CODE:**
```python
def process(data):
    if not data:
        raise ValueError("Data required")
    return transform(data)
```

**NEW CODE:**
```python
def process(data):
    """Process data with validation."""
    if not data:
        raise ValueError("Data required")
    return transform(data)
```

**Output:** `PASS` (just added docstring, no violations)

---

### Example 3: FAIL (Added Violation)
**OLD CODE:**
```python
def fetch(url):
    response = requests.get(url)
    response.raise_for_status()
    return response.json()
```

**NEW CODE:**
```python
def fetch(url):
    try:
        response = requests.get(url)
        response.raise_for_status()
        return response.json()
    except Exception:
        return {}  # VIOLATION ADDED
```

**Output:** `FAIL: Line 7: Exception â†’ empty dict return (violation #1)`

---

### Example 4: FAIL (Worsened)
**OLD CODE:**
```python
try:
    connect()
except ConnectionError:
    return None  # BAD but specific
```

**NEW CODE:**
```python
try:
    connect()
except Exception:
    return None  # WORSE - broader exception
```

**Output:** `FAIL: Line 3: Broadened exception handling from ConnectionError to Exception (worsened violation)`

---

## ANALYSIS APPROACH

1. Count violations in OLD CODE
2. Count violations in NEW CODE
3. Compare counts:
   - NEW < OLD = PASS (improvement)
   - NEW = OLD = PASS (no regression)
   - NEW > OLD = FAIL (regression)
4. For same count, check if severity changed

---

## REMEMBER

- Output ONLY "PASS" or "FAIL: <reasons>"
- NO markdown formatting
- NO explanations beyond failure reasons
- NO additional text
- Remediation = PASS
- Regression = FAIL
