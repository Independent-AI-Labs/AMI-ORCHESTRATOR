Your goal is to keep documentation synchronized with the actual codebase.\n\n## YOUR TASK\n\nYou will receive a documentation file below. Your job is to:\n\n1. **READ THE CODEBASE** - Use Read, Grep, Glob tools to understand what the code actually does\n2. **CHECK FOR AGENT NOTES** - Look for `#AGENT: <feedback>` comments in the doc\n3. **COMPARE** - Check if the documentation matches reality\n4. **DECIDE AND ACT** - Take ONE of three actions\n\n## Agent Feedback Notes\n\n**CRITICAL**: Before analyzing, scan the document for `#AGENT:` comments.\n\nThese are inline notes left by previous reviewers or users requesting specific updates:\n\n```markdown\n# Some Section\n\n#AGENT: This section is outdated, needs to describe the new v2 API\n\nOld content here...\n```\n\n**When you find `#AGENT:` notes:**\n- Treat them as MANDATORY requirements\n- Address each note in your update\n- Remove the `#AGENT:` comment after addressing it\n- If you can't address it, output FEEDBACK explaining why\n\n**Examples:**\n```markdown\n#AGENT: Add examples for the new authentication flow\n#AGENT: FEEDBACK HERE.\n#AGENT: Remove this section - feature deprecated\n#AGENT: Update benchmark numbers with latest results\n```\n\n## Action 1: UPDATE\n\nUse this when the doc is valuable but outdated.\n\n**When to UPDATE:**\n- Core information is correct but details are stale\n- Missing recently added features/APIs\n- Contains inaccurate examples or usage\n- Structure is good but content needs refresh\n\n**How to UPDATE:**\n- Use Edit tool to modify the documentation file\n- Fix outdated information\n- Add missing sections for new features\n- Remove obsolete content\n- Update code examples to match current API\n- Keep original file location and structure\n\n**What NOT to do:**\n- Don't create NEW documentation files (only edit existing)\n- Don't move the file (unless archiving)\n- Don't change file naming or organization structure\n\n## Action 2: ARCHIVE\n\nUse this when the doc has historical value but is no longer current.\n\n**When to ARCHIVE:**\n- Feature/API no longer exists in codebase\n- Superseded by newer/better documentation\n- Describes deprecated workflow\n- Still useful for historical reference\n- Migration guides for past versions\n\n**How to ARCHIVE:**\n- Ensure docs/archive/ directory exists (create if needed)\n- Move file to docs/archive/ using Bash tool\n- Add brief note at top of file explaining why archived\n- Keep original filename for traceability\n\n**Example archive note:**\n```markdown\n> **ARCHIVED**: This document describes the deprecated auth system removed in v2.0.\n> See docs/auth/README.md for current authentication documentation.\n\n[original content follows]\n```\n\n## Action 3: DELETE\n\nUse this when the doc has no value and should be removed.\n\n**When to DELETE:**\n- Completely obsolete with no historical value\n- Empty stub file or template\n- Exact duplicate of another doc\n- Abandoned draft with no useful content\n- Broken/corrupted file\n\n**How to DELETE:**\n- Output a deletion recommendation in your response\n- Explain clearly why deletion is appropriate\n- Note if content should be merged elsewhere\n- DO NOT actually delete the file yourself\n\n**Example deletion output:**\n```\nRECOMMEND DELETION: docs/temp-notes.md\nReason: Empty stub file created 2 years ago, contains only \"TODO: Write this\"\nNo valuable content to preserve.\n```\n\n## IMPORTANT RULES\n\n1. **Read codebase FIRST** - Never guess, always verify against actual code\n2. **One action only** - Don't UPDATE and ARCHIVE the same file\n3. **Preserve value** - When in doubt, UPDATE rather than DELETE\n4. **Be specific** - Cite actual code locations when updating\n5. **Follow CLAUDE.md** - Adhere to all project guidelines\n\n## AVAILABLE TOOLS\n\n- **Read** - Inspect codebase files\n- **Grep** - Search for patterns in code\n- **Glob** - Find files matching patterns\n- **Edit** - Update documentation content\n- **Bash** - Move files to archive (when needed)\n- **WebSearch/WebFetch** - Look up latest library docs if needed\n\n## COMPLETION PROTOCOL\n\nAfter taking action, output ONE completion marker:\n\n**Success:**\n```\nWORK DONE\n```\n\n**Blocked (need clarification):**\n```\nFEEDBACK: <specific reason you're blocked>\n```\n\n**Examples:**\n```\nWORK DONE\n```\n\n```\nFEEDBACK: Documentation references \"DataProcessor\" class but cannot find it in codebase - was it renamed or removed?\n```\n\n## WORKFLOW EXAMPLE\n\n1. Read the doc below to understand what it's supposed to describe\n2. Search codebase for relevant files (Grep, Glob)\n3. Read implementation files to verify current state\n4. Compare doc vs reality\n5. Decide: UPDATE, ARCHIVE, or DELETE\n6. Execute action\n7. Output \"WORK DONE\" or \"FEEDBACK:\"\n\n---\n\n## Documentation File to Maintain\n\nPath: .gcloud/google-cloud-sdk/lib/third_party/google/api/README.md\n\nContent:\n---\n\n## API Protos\n\nThis folder contains the schema of the configuration model for Google's\ninternal API serving platform, which handles routing, quotas, monitoring,\nlogging, and the like.\n\nGoogle refers to this configuration colloquially as the \"service config\",\nand the `service.proto` file in this directory is the entry point for\nunderstanding these.\n\n## Using these protos\n\nTo be honest, we probably open sourced way too much of this (basically by\naccident). There are a couple files in here you are most likely to be\ninterested in: `http.proto`, `documentation.proto`, `auth.proto`, and\n`annotations.proto`.\n\n### HTTP and REST\n\nThe `http.proto` file contains the `Http` message (which then is wrapped\nin an annotation in `annotations.proto`), which provides a specification\nfor REST endpoints and verbs (`GET`, `POST`, etc.) on RPC methods.\nWe recommend use of this annotation for describing the relationship\nbetween RPCs and REST endpoints.\n\n### Documentation\n\nThe `documentation.proto` file contains a `Documentation` message which\nprovides a mechanism to fully describe an API, allowing a tool to build\nstructured documentation artifacts.\n\n### Authentication\n\nThe `auth.proto` file contains descriptions of both authentication rules\nand authenticaion providers, allowing you to describe what your services\nexpect and accept from clients.\n\n## api-compiler\n\nGoogle provides a tool called [api-compiler][], which is a tool that accepts\na protocol buffer descriptor and a YAML file specifying some of the\noptions described in `service.proto`, and outputs a much more thorough\n`Service` descriptor based on the information it infers from the protos\nthemselves.\n\n  [api-compiler]: https://github.com/googleapis/api-compiler\n\n\n\nPREVIOUS ATTEMPT FAILED VALIDATION:\nWorker recommended deletion of a file in a gitignored vendor directory (.gcloud/). Gitignored files are not tracked by git and should not be part of documentation maintenance workflow. The documentation worker should only process files that are actually part of the AMI-ORCHESTRATOR repository (tracked by git or intended to be tracked). This file should have been skipped entirely, not deleted.**\n\nPlease fix the issues and try again."},"uuid":"20dcde49-0e3f-48c2-9a78-23e706e40cbb","timestamp":"2025-10-27T11:07:15.086Z"}
