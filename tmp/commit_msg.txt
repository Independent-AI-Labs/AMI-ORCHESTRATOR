fix: module detection regression breaking non-backend modules

## Critical Bug Fixed
find_module_root() in base/scripts/env/paths.py used incorrect module detection
logic (backend/ directory), breaking ux and other non-backend modules. Changed to
use actual module requirements per module_setup.py: pyproject.toml + tests/.

## Problem
Non-backend modules (ux, learning) could not be tested or pushed. When running
git_push.sh ux, tests executed at orchestrator level instead of ux level, discovering
516 tests from ALL modules and failing with import errors.

Root cause: find_module_root() traversed from ux → orchestrator because ux lacks
backend/ directory. pytest then used base/pytest.ini with testpaths=tests relative
to /base/, discovering base/tests/ which includes all submodules.

## Changes

### scripts/git_push.sh
Line 50: Standard monorepo pattern - parent repo dirty check ignores submodule
state to allow independent submodule work. Without this, pushing orchestrator
blocked when any submodule had WIP changes.

Line 97: Fixed test discovery bug - pass explicit tests/ path to pytest for
submodules (matching line 91 root behavior). Without this, pytest discovers from
base/tests/ instead of module/tests/.

### CLAUDE.md
Line 26: Clarified module directory instruction distinguishes code development
vs git operations. Previous ambiguity caused confusion about submodule commits.

### Cleanup
Deleted scripts/git_push.sh.backup (leftover from debugging)

### Submodule Pointers
- ux: Updated to 8155cf0 (now pushable after fix)
- base: Has unstaged paths.py fix (must be committed separately)

## Verification
After fix, ux push succeeded: pytest collected 1 test from ux/tests/ (not 516 from
all modules), tests passed, push completed.

## Impact
Unblocks all non-backend modules for testing and deployment. Fixes incorrect pytest
discovery behavior affecting all submodule pushes.
